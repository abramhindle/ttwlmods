This mod boosts chubby skag frequency, chubby damage, chubby HP,
chubby size, and makes chubby skags more common in Borderlands 3
and Arm's race. Chubby skags become tanky hunts where your COOP
partners will get flattened but hey at least you get some loot.
The chubby spawn rate is rather high and you can expect at least 2
in arm's race to spawn.

Balance help is appreciated.
