MurdercaneTime
=========

Changes the timing of the Arm's Race murdercane and its radius.

Choose fast, double, or grow for different timings and behaviours.

* Fast: 30 seconds per change and transition
* Grow: it grows quickly and stays there a while before it collapses on itself and shrinks quickly.
* Double: Doubles the transitions and stable times of the mudercane

Using a simple CSV file you can also specify your own time and generate your own mod!

This is best used with bossrace, where you might need a little more time to deal with those heavy mobs.
