Known Bugs
==========

Sometimes Survival, Supremecy, and Discipline get locked by spawns that don't activate. If you know how to fix this I'd really like to know how to address it. I have hand currated some seeds that work to get around this but that is slow and adhoc. I work around this by tuning the kinds of spawns.

Conflicts with Raid mod.

Sometimes spawns leak into basegame.
