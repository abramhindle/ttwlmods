OmegaMantikore Raid
===================

Fight the raid-level Omega Mantikore at the start of the Hyperion Slaughter Star.

Warning: this seems to make blue rain drop off of the map :(

For the modders, this is a demo stolen from altef-4's code of how to move a spawn location for a particular wave, move it physically in space, and then spawn a big baddie there. You can steal this further and jam it into your mod maybe move him somewhere fun.
