Mitosis Harker
==============

Harker is too easy, so why not let Harker split into multiple Harkers?
This mod lets Harker spawn other Harkers. Although it does have a bug, sometimes Harker loses his dog and squats, this is an invincible harker. But you can still leave victorous, just ignore him.
Add multiple Harkers to the end boss fight.
