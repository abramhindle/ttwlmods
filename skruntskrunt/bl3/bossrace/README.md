So do you want to get in a boss race? Arm's Race with different mobs!
Bosses! With their loot! Spawns named enemies in the place of normal
Arm's race mobs, except for Skags and Spider Ants. Also makes Chubby
Skags common in arm's race.

I win 10% of the games. It's hard. You should also try different seeds

Dying too much? Go find some chubby skags, go to the sewer arena, and
then go from there.
