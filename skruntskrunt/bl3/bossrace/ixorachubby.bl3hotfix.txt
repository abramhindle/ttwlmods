### This mod boosts chubby skag frequency, chubby damage, chubby HP,
### chubby size, and makes chubby skags more common in Borderlands 3
### Arm's race. Chubby skags become tanky hunts where your COOP
### partners will get flattened but hey at least you get some loot.
### The chubby spawn rate is rather high and you can expect at least 2
### in arm's race to spawn. 
###
### Balance help is appreciated.
